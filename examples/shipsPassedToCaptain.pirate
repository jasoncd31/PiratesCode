$$ This example shows how objects are passed by copy in PiratesCode

        me.pirates = pirates
        me.loot = loot
    }
}

    boats.add(Boat(1, 10))
    ahoy boats
}

ledger boats = [Boat(2, 100), Boat(3, 1000)]
addShip(boats)    $$ Should print the copy of the list of boats with the new boat
ahoy boats    $$ Original list of boats (without the added boat)
